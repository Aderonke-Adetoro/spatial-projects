# Energy+ 
## My very first project-based assignment as a data science student

**I hope you enjoy learning from my script as much as I enjoyed writing each step with descriptive comments and also learning**

This project will teach you about proper use of Python data types, data structures, and not-so-basic data cleaning techniques.

Access the data used in the **Dataset** folder, download to your PC with awareness of the folder it's downloaded and saved into (I don't want you having problems accessing the file properly).

After downloading to your PC, study the **pandasfiltering.py** script (please take it one step at a time) and try to replicate the data cleaning processes.

You can do it, I know you can and I'm rooting for you.

### PRO-TIPS
- Have an organized folder for your work
- Install the Pandas and NumPy libraries
- Solve each problem one at a time and seek deep understanding of why you're using each solution
- Don't be frustrated if you encounter an error, it's part of the game
- Again, approach each problem calmly and constructively
- Try to come up with new concepts you can apply to the dataset
- Explore! Explore! Explore! I'm rooting for you!!!
