# A program that calculates the distance between a city and three other locations using the OpenRouteService API

As students we've mainly calculated distances using a set of mathematical formula or on software using a ruler to draw a line and visualise the distance.

But what if you want to do this for 10 locations, or hundreds of locations? How efficient do you think the manual approach is? Not very efficient, yeah? I thought so too.

That is why I wrote this script, for you and I to automate distance calculation using programming language and Application Programming Interface (API) that still employs the use of our coordinates to generate the distance between places for us within seconds. Sounds cool, yeah? I felt the same way when I wrote the script and it worked.

I hope you'll be able to replicate this for locations of your choice.
Edit the destination dictionary with as many coordinates as you want, you can have it. 

I can't wait to learn about even more efficient ways to do this, I know there's one that I'm still alien to out there. I'll look for it and come back to show you when I understand it, until then, have fun working with and learning from my little script.
